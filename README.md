This is a Vite + React App used to fetch weather data for cities using an API and a search bar. You must click on the magnifying glass search icon to request the data for the city you type in. You will need to install your own API key from OpenWeatherMap.org.

Add .env file to the my-react-app folder and add the following: 
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your API key here
 
I hope you enjoy this app and it's styling as much as I do!
